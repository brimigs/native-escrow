# Solana Escrow Program

This is an escrow program built using Solana SDK version 2.3.1. The program allows two parties to exchange tokens in a trustless manner.

## Developer Experience Challenges with Solana SDK 2.3.1

### 1. **Version Compatibility Issues**
- SPL Token version 6.0.0 is not directly compatible with Solana SDK 2.3.1
- Had to use exact version pinning (=2.3.1) to avoid dependency conflicts
- Many examples online use newer SDK versions, making it difficult to find compatible code patterns

### 2. **Pack Trait Implementation**
- The `Pack` trait from `solana_program::program_pack` requires manual implementation
- No derive macros available in SDK 2.3.1, leading to boilerplate code
- Manual serialization/deserialization is error-prone

### 3. **Missing Modern Features**
- No `msg!` macro improvements that exist in newer versions
- Limited error handling capabilities compared to newer SDK versions
- No built-in support for discriminators in instruction parsing

### 4. **PDA (Program Derived Address) Handling**
- The PDA account must be passed explicitly in the accounts array
- No automatic PDA validation helpers
- Manual nonce tracking required

### 5. **Account Validation**
- All account ownership and signer checks must be done manually
- No account constraints or validation macros
- Easy to forget critical security checks

### 6. **Documentation Gaps**
- Limited documentation for SDK 2.3.1 specifically
- Most tutorials and guides target newer versions
- Had to refer to source code frequently

### 7. **Testing Complexity**
- `solana-program-test` version 2.3.1 has limited features
- Setting up test environments is verbose
- No built-in test helpers for common patterns

### 8. **Borsh Integration**
- Using Borsh 0.10.3 with SDK 2.3.1 requires careful version management
- Different serialization behavior compared to newer versions
- Manual implementation of serialization for complex types

### 9. **Error Propagation**
- Custom error types require manual conversion to ProgramError
- No `?` operator support for custom errors without From trait implementation
- Limited error context compared to newer versions

### 10. **Development Tooling**
- Limited IDE support for SDK 2.3.1
- Cargo check/clippy warnings due to outdated patterns
- Build times are longer compared to newer SDK versions

## TODO: Solana Rust SDK Improvements for Better Developer Experience

### High Priority
- [ ] **Derive Macros for Common Traits**
  - Add `#[derive(Pack)]` for automatic serialization/deserialization
  - Add `#[derive(Instruction)]` for automatic instruction parsing with discriminators

- [ ] **Account Validation Framework**
  - Built-in account constraint macros (e.g., `#[account(mut, signer)]`)
  - Automatic ownership validation
  - PDA validation helpers with automatic seed checking

- [ ] **Error Handling Improvements**
  - Better error propagation with `?` operator support
  - Rich error context with source location tracking
  - Standardized error codes across programs

### Medium Priority
